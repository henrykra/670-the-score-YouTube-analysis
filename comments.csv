540,"Ok, this not so much a comment more about the of the folly listening to any Breakdowns on any sport channel about anything.   If you look on the side for Bears discussions you see , Fields best game ever,  then you will see he had some problems, but more the fault of the coaching anyway you get the idea.   Fields good team and Coaching Bad. People are all over the Map. lately, more comments are suggesting what have been commenting about concerning Fields staying.    If and when he starts playing well , the Bears will not pay him $200,000,000 for a new contract.  The better he plays the more likely he will want to go to a team with a more immediate chance for the Playoffs and will pay the money.  Do you really think Bears will pay a guy who will be in his 6 years by time the Bears are competitive that much money.  Even structured over 10 years Do you really see Fields running around in his tenth  year.  The Bears coaching will have to change his approach to being a QB.   Which has been proven is not what likes or plays to his strengths.  So, at it least amount of money per year it is 20,000,000. Plus, he has some injuries. If the plan is to let Fields be fields will not last.   He  ran 18 times last week. How long can he continue.     Quik ending, the Bears will not pay him because he not good, it because he may play to well and cost too much to keep him.....Anyone remember the Roquan Smith contract talks..........All these snap headlines are just to put eyeballs on the channels and Sport show guys a chance to talk.",f38d16MhD1w,UgzB902yDI4MRsfg2oV4AaABAg,False,

The poor coaching staffs can‚Äôt say jack or they‚Äôll be reported to HR and fired. Reference David Walker. The best field sport on earth has been ruined by un-coachable misfits.  D.J.

996,"Chicago media and fans have become fixated on having an 'elite' QB because the Bears franchise has never had one. I think that's clouding many peoples judgement, but hopefully not Ryan Poles'. I think it's completely fair to speculate and debate what the Bears should do about Getsy, Eberflus, and Fields. I think Poles has been a far superior GM to Pace so far, it's really not close. Pace failed repeatedly on day 1 & 2 draft picks, and occasionally got lucky on some day 3 picks. Pace was so bad on day 1 & 2 picks he started trading them away like candy for expensive veteran players, which is the opposite of the way to build a team. Poles has gone after trades to increase his picks in the draft, and has done a solid job so far on day 1 & 2 picks, the only exception being Velus Jones. Poles has been better than Pace on day 3 picks also. The trade for Chase Claypool obviously didn't work out, but that was due to Claypool's personality and effort, not his talent or ability. Poles decision making on that trade was sound, but that doesn't guarantee that everything works out. Poles trade for the #1 overall pick last year was great. He ended up with 3 starters from that so far, including two that are likely blue chip players. His subtle trades in 2022 gave him 11 picks in the draft instead of just 5. He ended up with 3 starters from that draft, not counting the punter. I've heard Poles be blamed for hiring this coaching staff, but by the time Poles was hired, the Bears had narrowed the coaching choices to Quinn, Eberflus, and Caldwell. Quinn quickly removed himself from consideration to remain with the Cowboys. Eberflus might not be the most exciting head coach, but he may not be terrible either. His biggest issue, as with many coordinators hired as first time head coaches, might be his choices of coaching staff. Particularly for the side of the ball he's not as familiar with. I'd like to see Poles continue on the same path towards building the overall roster, rather than gambling on selecting a QB that gets off to a hot start. I'd like to see Poles assemble a roster like the Eagles or 49ers, that can win and be successful without needing a HOF QB.

Trade that pick to the most QB desperate team in existence and stock pile those picks just like last year. Dynasties are built this way!  Just imagine if they had used their 1st overall pick last year on a quarterback. Would we have DJ Moore? Nope. Darnel Wright? Nope. Montez Sweat? Nope. Would we be in position to have the 1st overall pick this year? Nope.  The Bears are one or two pieces away from having an ELITE defense. They just need one more big time playmaker on the d-line and someone to eventually replace Eddie Jackson at the safety position. Offensively, they badly need a center, and while Braxton Jones is decent enough for a young player, if they can get a dominant left tackle (along with a center) this o-line can be REALLY good! After that they could use another receiver opposite Moore and maybe another TE opposite Kmet, and then they just need some depth. They really aren't that many pieces away from being good to very good to potentially great on all sides of the ball, and with the sheer draft capital they can get with the 1st overall pick plus their own pick, they will have so much damned YOUNG and CHEAP talent on this roster that they won't know what to do with it. They will also be able to set themselves up for years to come to continue to add pieces without vastly overpaying guys THUS ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE GOOD TO GREAT FOR YEARS ON END! And if the QB situation doesn't work out with Fields next season, they will have the draft capital to get a QB in next years draft no problem.  It just pains me to think of how much they'd have to sacrifice in order to get a QB who isn't a sure thing anyway. All of those offensive linemen, defensive linemen, wide outs, safeties, and whoever else they can get with all of that draft capital wasted on some goddamned quarterback that they don't need would be infuriating.  I hope to God Carolina loses out and the Bears get the number 1 pick and trade that sucker to some desperate, sorry ass franchise for everything its worth. I hope they draft well on both sides of the ball, especially the trenches, extend Jaylon Johnson, and give Flus and Fields a chance to really see what they are made of with the talent they will add next season.

Second, I believe he needs to see the field better.

Instead of using all 3 seconds, if he gets that to wait for the route to fully develop when separation happens, he stops looking after 2 seconds because the ticker in his head tells him to drop his head and look for a hole to run through.

1609,"Can't argue with Kurt, he's a superbowl winning QB. My only insight is that maybe there's other factors at play? Does Justin Fields have all star ability both running and passing? Yes. Does he try to make something out of nothing a lot of times which leads to his fumbling issues? Yes. But the few problems he has can be smoothed out easily, and if that does happen he has the potential to be one of the scariest players in the league. His peers love him, his team mates love him, opposing coaches say they have nightmares game planning for him, and he has improved as a passer, slowly but surely. Getting injured really sucked because he was on a roll before that, but he's played well after the injuries too. Even in the Vikings game he almost had 300 total yards, even though neither team could score in the red zone.

The fact of the matter is ownership has not changed since they allowed Pace to draft Justin Fields. Bears ownership should not have allowed a lame duck Pace and Nagy to draft anyone in 2021.

A lot of these so called experts are handy cappers and degenerate gamblers masquerading as football experts. PFF does this same bull shish. PFF are handy cappers.

2319,"The Ravens Jaguars game is a perfect example to juxtapose the discussion about Fields.  On one hand you look at Lamar Jackson who had  171 yds passing 1 TD 1 Int but almost 100 yds rushing.  Not great passing numbers but the Ravens dominated the game.  All the talk is how Lamar controls the game.  The commentary on him is how great a player he is and what a difference maker.  Obviously, he‚Äôs not just doing it with pure passing, it‚Äôs his overall dynamic play that effects the game.  On the other hand is Trevor Lawrence.  The previous ‚Äúgenerational‚Äù QB that currently has more interceptions AND fumbles than JF1 in his third year. He was not effective enough to keep JAX in the game and fumbled the ball twice last night.  There is no talk about replacing him.  I think people should be careful about who they think will be a star QB.  We just really don‚Äôt know.  All of these guys have talent but I think fit matters.

Nobody is killing Lamar for doing what he does best and not because it doesn‚Äôt look like a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù QB game.  The NFL is different today.  QB‚Äôs and offenses can get it done in different ways.  It‚Äôs working out for Baltimore, Philly, Buffalo and so on.  I think we should consider doing the same with JF1.

Well, isn't that what Luke got killed for in the first GB game and the Minnesota game? He doesn't get the ball out consistently quick, he doesn't read the field fast enough (slow processor), and the Oline is sometimes vulnerable to a strong pass rush. The OC, though not perfect, is kinda in a lose-lose situation with this QB. Justin doesn't hand 2 Hall of Famer WRs and a legendary half-back who is considered the greatest catching RB.

2577,"Awesome interview.  I am a new fan of Jaylon, especially for his honesty and the heart he shows.  Polls needs to keep this team together and show and tell them he believes in them and not just be a GM.  It takes heart then go into battle with the team.  Jaylon is so right, Justine has never had any stability since being in Chicago, it's the owners fault to start with and the Bears finally must hire a coach that has been a good head coach, not an assistant and especially go get a good play caller that understands how to make the needed adjustments on offense as the game requires.  I am just another Buckeye believer and i will tell you straight up....Urban and Ryan knew that Justine was one of the best athlete's in college football and they knew he was a leader and hard worker, and with all of that to start and with the great coaching at Ohio State and the talent he would have around him, the team would succeed.  THEY DID.  POLLS needs to see the same and do the same.  Another thing, all the students loves Justine, columbus loves Justine,  Buckeye Nation including our 11 million alum love Justine, he has a kind heart is an awesome person, as is his family and he didn't act like a jock, he was just one of us.  We believe in him and follow him still and since y'all haven't figured it out, what i just said about Urban and Ryan tells you how to win with him.  Y'all kept changing coaches, tried to make him mechanical,  held him back from not being who he is, didn't give him all the support the team needs to win it all, allowed the press and media keep talking about him negatively instead of putting that fire our right away because you believed in him and and showed support, after all you are responsible to assure each Bear is part of the Bear family you will also fight for.  Polls is on the right course, he has brought him some awesome talent that fits this year and we are all seeing it on the filed.  Don't start over with destroying another new quarterback, keep building on what you are doing with Justine leading.  We all see what your players feel of Justine, they believe in him and feel he is their leader.  Like they say sure he makes mistakes like all of them do and he has going threw some growing pains but he is there now even after you didn't put an end to this media talk of is Justine on the trading block.  He has lost some confidence not getting the right support from the coaches not Polls.  We all see the real problem is in the front office and on the sideline coaches.  Polls just keep doing what you are doing now keeping brining in the right pieces to be part of the talent you already have.  Keep walking forward through the fire just as our soldiers do in war, don;t turn your back on the difficulties because they are politically good for you, that's what our government does when they send our soldiers to war, yet don't back them up.  Like Vietnam, we never lost a battle but our government leaders gave the enemy the game.  Buckeye Nation is your new audience and we a huge one, and we do football everyday.  We got Justine's back.  Mr. Polls we see you are doing good now with the new pieces just need a few more to add to what you have, a center, o-tackle,  maybe another player on defense and another to beef up the competition and back up.  We all see your players talk about their support for Justine and he is their leader and how he hasn't had the stability in coaching, but they will follow him into the fire and fight their way through it and win, win, win as long as their General's don't take that ability away from them.  Also you need another tight end big time, a good blocker, speed and ability to win at least 90% of contested catches, we got you one and it is easy,  Cade Stover of the Ohio State Buckeyes, just watch the film, and we all know you must grab Marvin Harrison, Jr. number 1 in the draft.  With a running back,  this tight end, MHJ, a center and tackle, your mission will be accomplished.   NOW GO GET THE JOB DONE DO NOT OVER THINK WHAT NEEDS DONE, IT'S SIMPLE, WE WANT THE BEARS IN THE SUPER BOWL AND IT CAN HAPPEN NEXT YEAR.  NEW PLAY CALLER AND COACH.

Not only have the Bears never had a top tier or HOF QB but same with wide receiver. Boring and disappointing would the words to describe their offense historically if you ask me. But for the die hard stick around fans if you‚Äôre satisfied with Fields then get one of the top receivers and that stud OL Alt. Plus you can trade down from No. 1 and pick up a second round and third round pick although Bears are not the best at drafting except for a couple of positions like LB and RB. Anyway good luck.

3317,"The Bears are playing exactly how I use them on Madden 24. I started 0-20 before I began to find a winning strategy with the Bears. In my scheme I assure JF1 is a threat to run to open up the other skills positions. I put the DJM in the slot because it gives him more space to operate between the curls and through the hook aka the middle of the field which is an important area you must attack. Football is a game of space, timing, force, and anticipation. By giving Moore, more space by being in the slot you change the timing of the offense in dramatic fashion and things move quicker for the defense. Moore also brings force throughout the middle. With velocity and strength Moore is creating a situation which any defender in that middle may have to collide with him and DJM, he is a very powerful athlete and moves like a runaway freight train. This concept is obscure as you must realize this affects the internal instincts of the defenders as the play is going on. Moony has speed and needs to play more outside WR with DJM in the slot. Another idea is A double slot formation which should consist of Moony and Moore with your big targets Kement and St. Brown operating on the outside looking to take advantage of smaller DB's while inside personnel has to put up with velocity and force through the middle as well as account for JF1 running the ball. It would be too much stress for any defense. I don't care about being humble so I'm just going to say it. I have been 10 steps ahead of Getsy the whole season. I think the Bears should hire me as Getsy's assistant. I think $1,000,000 per day would be reasonable or is that too much?   UPDATE: I was just looking over the game and analyzing JF1's passing mechanics. I have been critical of JF1 stating that he has some bad throwing habits that he likely picked up from playing shortstop in high school. I believe JF1 could be traded to the Cubs where he would be an all-star shortstop in return, I would want the Harry Carry statue moved to Soldier Field.  Like a short stop JF1 loads up his back foot to get throwing power and with that comes and exaggerated elbow motion and a high front leg kick. These habits throw off the timing of his reads. I stated that if he throws more from the hips, he will find the timing to throw into tighter windows and that is exactly what happened in this against Atlanta. The better he gets at passing like this the better his passing stats will get. Of course, I blamed Getsy and also wondered why this wasn't fixed in his rookie year. In this game there are multiple throws where you can see JF1 is keeping the front foot low to the ground which minimizes the exaggerated elbow and creates more hip torque and gives him about .2-.3 seconds more time to fit the ball into a tighter window. This was why he had success on the TD to DJM. That was truly a tight window, from over-the-top no less which is something I am having a difficult time understanding. I am truly impressed with some of his throws this game and while he seems to be doing what I wanted to see in terms of throwing mechanics, I can't explain the pinpoint accuracy he has to drop it from over the top. I suppose it's most likely timing. I realize now that vision(anticipation) + throwing mechanics + timing = ball trajectory or something close to this. JF1 has a unique ball trajectory, and a route and throwing strategy needs to be tailor made to JF1's ball trajectory which in turns will confuse defenses. Think of how Mayweather threw punches from unique angles as well as took unique angles in his posture for defense. It's hard for the opposing boxer to mimic this style so that he can practice against these angles. Damn, we have a very unique guy.",950yrCCeL9g,UgwF_Hvz-4LmhauBIjJ4AaABAg,False,

3334,@@elijahweathers2058 This is true and remains a valid criticism among others of Williams. The thing is that Williams is special because of what he does outside the structure of the offense. Of course drafting a QB is almost always throwing a dart at a board. I find this risk acceptable because I'm out on Fields. The ball never comes out quick because Fields is a slow processor. He doesn't throw in-breaking routes because he's incapable of throwing with anticipation. Defenses have to divert resources from defending the pass because of how good Fields is as a runner and he's still a mediocre passer. Sorry but I'm done with Fields. Add Pokes and Eberdouche to that list. I hate being a Bears fan!,950yrCCeL9g,UgwOSE98HPh5q46gP294AaABAg.9z0IoB2GrSP9z1uZQWNvpq,True,UgwOSE98HPh5q46gP294AaABAg

He's got 2 whole games this season with multiple passing touchdowns. Running qb's always get hurt at some point and/or decline quickly once their legs get beat up. The window to win championships is incredibly narrow for them. That's the real issue here. I want this team to win. Fields took 3 years to get to mid.

3351,"I usually always the guy whose all about drafting the QB to reset the clock and build a strong team around him   But this scenario is so intriguing it‚Äôs crazy. I‚Äôm not a huge fields guy but I‚Äôll be honest. This Caleb Williams kid gives me a lot of red flags.   I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm sold on fields as a pure thrower. All I know is I like his character a whole lot and I‚Äôm scared to death of Caleb‚Äôs.  Plus the other wrinkle is everyone thinks Caleb is this really great generational prospect plus you got another legit generational WR in the same draft.   That‚Äôs a lot to consider. Idk for me my mind leads towards keep fields and draft the generational WR while getting more compensation.   You won‚Äôt get fired for drafting Marvin Harrison. Kids a stud. However you will if you pass on Marvin, give up on fields who everyone loves, and then Caleb is a bust.   The surest thing right now is you know that you will get a bust free player in Harrison. You know you‚Äôll get a break return to move down just one slot. And you know even if Caleb turns out alright that you went with a guy that the players and fans rallied behind. At least if fields isn‚Äôt as good as Caleb you have a good team overall with assets and you can bring in a new QB   If I‚Äôm the bears I exercise the 5th year. And give give 2 more full years with an amazing support staff.   Go all in. Trade down to get something like a pick flop, Jonathan Allen and a 2nd.   Use that second to go get a player like pitts who on a terrible team and in his last rookie deal year. He‚Äôs stunk for them but he‚Äôs so talented. Him with Marvin moore and cole would be dynamic.   Then draft either a pass rusher or a lineman with your second first rounder. Fill in the Rest with best player available.  Caleb can either be mahomes 2.0 or he can be a bust. I‚Äôd bet on the latter when you consider what‚Äôs in the line if you‚Äôre wrong. Lost a ton of assets plus Marvin. Plus fields. Dude is only 6‚Äô1. He‚Äôs plays really small in the pocket by sinking his hips if you watch his film. Very sporadic and doesn‚Äôt as play well in structure. Gunslinger. And I‚Äôm in the camp of worrying about his maturity level and temperament to lead men.  You can dislike fields all you want when it comes to his play at times‚Ä¶ and I agree ‚Ä¶ but you can‚Äôt say the kid isn‚Äôt tough. And you can‚Äôt say he‚Äôs immature or that he‚Äôs not a good leader. He does a lot of things right when it comes to what you want character wise.

If they aren't *consistently* there, you need to look at when they are or aren't, then try to figure things out. Preferably _without_ jumping to any conclusions before you start. Long story short, based on unconfirmed reports & knowing Fields has no cognitive issues, while I haven't *found* it yet but someone said D.J. Moore said that on certain RPO plays, the coaches tell Fields in advance that either you pass to Receiver A & Receiver A ONLY or you run. Now look at those plays where Fields scrambles for his life only to stare down the field at an open receiver then decides not to throw to them. That was based on his coaches telling him in advance to not throw to open receivers.  I mean, wtf can anyone even _do_ with that?

But let me ask you something: how long would it take for any team owners or coaches to figure out what to do about this if Joe Burrow or Justin Herbert suddenly stared out at open receivers? One entire game? Two entire plays before taking them out suspecting that they missed a concussion? The Bears continued this for a Full Calendar Year.

Not a rebuild torn to the studs but a complete demolition and excavation of the roster, draft capital, and salary cap mobility. Poles promised to build through the draft and everyone should know that that means at least 3 years. The first year Poles didn't have a first round pick but was still able to hit on a couple of picks and took the best players available. This last year he did some magic and set the Bears up with extra draft capital. The whole team, coaches included, were learning new job titles and positions. The team is growing together and it's already starting to show promise and a foundation can be seen. The fact that the Chicago media has pretended all year that winning every game and winning the division was ever really possible is total crap and manufactured story lines. There has been growth in multiple positions in all three phases of the team. This team would run through walls for each other and the coaching staff. The Bears are finally finally doing it the right way. It's been almost 40 years since Chicago last won the Superbowl and they have failed every year since. The Green Bay game showed that the Bears need to bolster both the offensive and defensive lines. If Poles is able to have another good draft this April the Bears should be in great shape to compete for a wildcard spot this upcoming season. If the plan is to build an explosive roster on both sides of the ball and then lastly find their QB by either drafting him or trading for him or signing a free agent then I think that's a pretty good plan. Something that I have always liked about the Bears organization is that they are loyal and give the players time to develop and the coaches time to install their systems. Mitch got 4 years and so should Fields. They are still more than a QB away from competing for a championship. Get as many shots at acquiring blue chip talent as you can. They then can fill out the rest with some free agents and possibly trades. If after next season Fields still hasn't shown that the lightbulb has come on then go sign a veteran QB.

The Bears Offense was the DJ Moore, Cole Kmet and the run game. Justin will often times make an accurate throw to someone other than Dj or Cole just for them to drop it or stop running their route when it really matters so when Justin throws an bad pass people chastise him for it. And Luke Getsy is easily one of the most inconsistent playcallers I've ever had the displeasure of  watching. When mutiple players on the team call out the playcalling and other NFL analyst watch Bears film and can't figure out what the Bears are scheming that screams incompetence. People blame everytime Justin holds onto the ball because he can't read a defense when maybe nobody's open because the playcall was awful or/and nobody can get open. And it doesn't help that Getsy is so predictable that a toddler can guess what the Bears are going to do every play.  The Bears need to get rid of Getsy and hire an OC that can play into Justin's strengths (Or whoever the Bears pick at QB) and get quality depth at WR. I believe that even with Caleb or Maye, you'd still have the same issue. Since Justin was drafted he had literally had no reliable weapons (Dj & Cole excluded) compared to T-Law who at least got solid WR depth after his first offseason. Justin had just got Dj Moore. He was in year 3.  Whether the Bears keep or get rid of Justin doesn't matter if they fail to fix the root of the issue but at least put talent around them so that they don't have to be Superman every play.

Eberfluss is doing exactly as he said he was going to do and fields is contributing to it. You get rid of fields, we lose a strong player that knows how to be a threat not just on the ground, but up the field.

Why would you take that risk when you‚Äôre already have a quarterback that has shown tremendous growth, has shown that when given time in the pocket, has shown when given more weapons, better players around him, better blocking etc. that he can be a winning quarterback in the NFL‚Ä¶ Without a doubt. The only times he struggled is when the pocket collapses, when the blocking sucks, when receivers aren‚Äôt open, other than that he‚Äôs made tremendous that most quarterbacks could not make, in fact he‚Äôs more impressive making difficult throws than Jordan love‚Ä¶ And Jordan love is a good quarterback, he played a great game, but his receivers were wide-open, they have a lot more talent on defense and offense so what do you expect especially with a quarterback who‚Äôs been sitting and learning for four years behind Aaron Rodgers what is the greatest whoever played the game? Of course he‚Äôs going to be a better quarterback, of course he‚Äôs got more experience coaching. So you can‚Äôt say the same about Justin Fields and his situation‚Ä¶ And drafting another quarterback is just taking another risk when you don‚Äôt have to take another risk because you know where Justin fields can be‚Ä¶ His ceiling is higher than these other quarterbacks in the draft‚Ä¶ But if they want to draft the quarterback take one in the mid rounds‚Ä¶ A developmental type player who has the skills like Brock Purdy‚Ä¶ Like the guy they have now on Tyson agent‚Ä¶ It takes time‚Ä¶ And the media in Chicago just doesn‚Äôt have the patience which is ridiculous because it took 10 years to build that 85 Bears team at least 10 years‚Ä¶ This was only the second year and Justin didn‚Äôt even play a full season‚Ä¶ Last year was his real rookie year so next season with more talent this team can be a playoff contender‚Ä¶ So stick with him keep building around him rather than tearing it down and starting over with an unknown quarterback who could end up being Another mistake‚Ä¶ So I take that chance when you already have someone that you know has the talent and ability plus the mental make up and character/work ethic to be a really good NFL quarterback if not great.",OBRS-VQALaQ,UgzyIEC_ctfWkIvCxZJ4AaABAg,False,

Once you have that system in place, then you go and get players that fit that system.  No one player can automatically transform a franchise unless he has a proven system implemented by the team to put them in a position to succeed and clearly the Bears don't have that yet. My point is why spend a draft on one player who still has no experience in the NFL, has proven in college that he has trouble with great defenses, is a smaller version than the incumbent QB, when you have a lot of holes to fill in this team, specifically the side thats supposed to protect the QB. Not that Caleb isn't going to be great, but what point does it make to draft him and still have to deal with the problems that hamper the Bears now on the offensive line?",15oN-0Fm5LI,UgzST3kubUCumPbFATx4AaABAg,False,

Tom Brady was infamously a 6th round pick 199th overall, Drew Brees 2nd round pick 32nd overall, Aaron Rodger 1st round 24th overall and Ben Roethlisberger 1st round 11th overall. Which I think supports his logic and argument that you dont have to draft a guy no 1 overall to win in this league. Outside of Ben Roethislberger  and Tom Brady none of those QBs really had success in their early years, you can also add in Russell Wilson and Pat Mahomes to early hits, but none of those 4 went no.1 overall and 2 of those 4 weren't even drafted in the 1st. And arguably none of the QBs I mentioned that had early success really walked into a truly messed up franchise in disarray. Drafting Caleb Williams would be banking on success in year 3 or 4 at best. Years 1 and 2 are surely to be developmental years or on the job training. So in 4-5 years, this team will look 100 percent different. You might have 4-5 holdovers if you're lucky. This is just my gut feeling. If I really wanted to investigate this notion, I would just go back and look at the 2020 Chicago Bears and see whos still on the team from then.

4972,"As a Bears fan for 60 years now, OMG!, I found this interview maddening. Parkins is correct in this situation and here's why...the Bears NEVER hire a well paid coach...EVER! Harbaugh would have definitely chosen the Bears if they did. Would he have wanted Williams at #1? I doubt it. My guess is he would have wanted McCarthy with the 9th pick and wanted to trade down a couple spots and taken Harrison. Now that Harbaugh, and all other proven great coaches are out of the realm of possibility, they NEED to draft Williams in HOPES of having a game changer. Someone who can elevate in spite of the lack of quality coaching. Waldron could be a really good coordinator, provided that Eberflus doesn't try to influence offensive game plans as he did with Getsy. But I think Eberflus WILL interfere as he worries for his own job, and his lack of knowledge regarding offensive game planning will doom this team. If you remember when McMahon was drafted, by Halas himself, Vince Evans was the incumbent QB. Vince had some similarities to JF. Many people liked Vince and wanted him to remain the Bears QB, including myself and all of my friends. That lasted until I actually watched McMahon take the field and throw the ball like Vince never could. This kid Williams is the exact same type of gunslinger that McMahon was when drafted. Without McMahon the Bears never would have made it to a Superbowl much less won it. This is it Bears fans, this is the chance to get a top notch consensus QB. If they don't draft him and never get to the Superbowl again, all of those crying to trade the pick will be to blame. I thought the Bears would be smart enough to hire Harbaugh. They NEVER learn.

5912,"It is generally true that the media people who most want to dump Fields are White men, even though I have heard black men who want to do so as well and white who want to keep him.  I do believe it says something about us as a society in regards to attitudes in regards to fairness. To keep it simple the pro Fields forces see a major talent that needed grooming and coaching and a supporting cast like all good performing QBs have and who did not get it. They know for instance that you cannot blame Fields for losing games when the GM was blatantly tanking, or the offensive line is bad at pass protection and maybe the reason he holds on to the ball too long is because receivers are not getting open and when they do they drop perfect passes.  The anti Fields people have no such sense of fairness. They say hey Caleb could be Mahomes and they have no sense of giving Justin a fair shot of being in a good environment. They do not care that the Bears have only one top 100 player in their team that being DJ Moore who just came to the team this past season, while Mahomes probably at least 5 or 6 or more. They do not care that Braxton Jones is like the 24th ranked left tackle while Mahomes has a top one or that Mahomes has Andy Reid while Fields had Getsy. Personally I think going for Williams is thinking shortcut while trading and getting a couple second round picks and maybe future first round picks or another top veteran like They got DJ Moore is thinking about building on a more sure and solid foundation for one but also as a bonus is treating Fields decently and being fair to a guy who is of good character.

They get the 2 pick and Washington's 36th pick in second round and their firstround pick in 2025. It's not high because other teams will bid the price up who also clamor for the next Mahomes. Then the Bears auction off the second pick to get either a massive haul from some QB hungry team like the Falcons at 8 or the Broncos at 12 or the Raiders at 13. Assuming Caleb went 1 to Commanders these teams plus the Patriots will be trying to make sure they get the second best QB. But the Bears should get the price up then just trade with the Patriots to go down to the 3rd pick.  Now from the Patriots they get.a high second round picks and a first rounder and a fourth rounder next season in  2025. Again given the bidding war for that QB Maye or Daniels, etc, it's a fair price. With the third pick the Bears get the best player in the draft at a position of urgent need, Marvin Harrison, a truly generational talent. Now with 9th pick, the Bears can go more trading. So far off the board already will be Caleb Williams Drake Maye Jayden Daniels, Alt, Nabers, Odunze for sure and likely Dallas Turner and Fashanu, all the truly top tier talent will be drafted by that time.  The Bears could at this point get either the second best tackle or second best edge rusher, or they could trade down some more and get more draft capital. JJ McCarthy likely to have some team salivating to get such a winner QB who always wins his games.  Maybe the Broncos or to be Raiders might still be looking for their QB or maybe the Steelers might want to make the leap or the Vikings. The Bears trade down again and get let's say a third round pick this year and a third rounder in 2025. After that trade down the Bears still get either a starting level edge rusher or a starter left tackle upgrade from Braxton Jones. After that they have so many early picks in the second  through 4th rounds that they easily get a Center starter, a second wide receiver, a tight and a safety who are all starter level talent.  This is the best trade scenario for Bears without a doubt.  This strategy is capitalism at work, supply and demand for QB prospects. The Bears can maneuver slowly down the draft board since they already have a good QB in place and literally become the gatekeeper brokers of team wanting to draft the top QBs in the draft and potentially be able to do more of the same in 2025 because more than likely the teams who first round picks they own will be bad in 2025 with all those young learning QBs, and we do it again next year.",ZxuWckWwtgs,UgxGukVIvRwfQB_gKzF4AaABAg.A-u-kh1b2-YA-uiuzZyr7-,True,UgxGukVIvRwfQB_gKzF4AaABAg

6870,"To all Bear fans, I was a huge advocate to keeping JF1 and trading down for a haul, however, u guys should‚Äôve expected that pretty much every move on offense coaching staff or player wise that‚Äôs occurred this offseason has been predicated to drafting Caleb. Waldron, Brown, etc wouldn‚Äôt be here if they didn‚Äôt get a chance to coach Caleb. The writing was on the wall when they all got here. Everybody passed up on certain jobs, in Waldron‚Äôs case, maybe a HC job. To me that goes to show how much they really wanted the opportunity to coach him. I think JF1‚Äôs a phenomenal talent, however, please pay close attention to how he plays. Outside of the explosive plays he‚Äôs had vs 49ers, Dolphins, Lions, etc, and some throws to DJ, you can‚Äôt tell me he doesn‚Äôt struggle with reading opposing defenses. He has to at least take some accountability such as the sacks he‚Äôs taken, missing throws downfield. I‚Äôve seen plays where the Oline did well enough where he was supposed to throw a quick check down but instead holds onto the ball too long, runs into a lineman, and thus taking a sack or fumble. The whole Getsy exp was a bad 1 for all involved. Who knows now if Getsy truly was able to call his entire offensive arsenal or had to change things to cater for JF1. It is on Poles that he was part of bringing in Getsy in the 1st place, gms do make mistakes, esp young 1s who at the time just started. I don‚Äôt like the return either, but behind the scenes wise, if a 6th rd pick was the only pick offered, Poles had to take it. ‚ÄúReports‚Äù were saying more was offered but Poles took this cuz he wanted to do right by JF1, we may never know of that intent either, bottom line is he‚Äôs off to Pittsburgh for a 6th, it is what it is. You guys forget that pretty much every QB spot‚Äôs filled already, even backups. If Poles didn‚Äôt move him there, JF1 eventually would‚Äôve been cut or risk the endless noise in Chicago from fans wanting to keep JF1 over Caleb. No way Poles would trade in division with Minnesota and thus Steelers had an opening when they moved Pickett. For some reason, Titans love Levis and I don‚Äôt think Payton would take JF1 in Denver either and the NY teams have Tyrod and Lock as backups. To me, JF1 was failed by Nagy/Pace. No QB would‚Äôve succeeded in that mess of a situation in 21‚Äô. JF1 was set up to fail by them from Day 1. They drafted him to keep their jobs a little longer, which ended up succeeding for that yr but ended up screwing next yrs draft cap. Poles, Cunningham and Co. inherited an ugly situation from Pace and Co. with aging vets, bad cap, less draft capital. JF1 at least was a bright spot out of all of this but you guys gotta understand that a new regime very likely wants to take their guy at QB, not inherit 1. Change is/was inevitable there. And another big reason y JF1 had to be moved now is imagine if both Caleb and JF1 shared a locker room together. Bear fans would‚Äôve kept chanting JF1 for eons, leaving both guys in a terrible situation. Now Caleb‚Äôs in the best situation a #1 pick QB has had since maybe ever? I‚Äôll believe it when I see it if everything goes to plan which so far it looks like it is. Everyone can move on from this QB debate and now all eyes to Caleb. For those saying we only have 4 picks left and no capital, u do realize that Poles has traded down countless times right? I highly doubt we end up selecting only 4 guys. I‚Äôll say we end up with 7-8 picks overall. And for those saying Poles‚Äôs a terrible gm, look at the mess he had to clean up when he came in and look at the players he‚Äôs brought in now. U want to criticize that Claypool trade, go right ahead cuz it‚Äôs the worst move he‚Äôs made by far so far in his regime which resulted in the pick being Joey Porter Jr., but outside of that, u guys can‚Äôt deny the talent he‚Äôs been able to bring in. My hope is Oline is what he drafts by trading down from 9 to somewhere around 11-20. Odunze and Nabers would be awesome, but Oline is where it all starts. Hopefully JPJ‚Äôs the pick. And look at the Mack and Roquan contracts. Would u guys make Roquan the highest paid LB when u literally just started the job and thought it could damage your future cap or would u spend less than that for Edwards/Edmunds/Sanborn? And would u keep Mack, that huge contract that LA basically had to convince him to restructure cuz it‚Äôs that massive and when he was here coming off a down yr/major foot injury or have a really good S in Brisker with the pick we got from LA by moving him? And moving another big contract in an aging Robert Quinn to Philly for a 4th which turned out to be Tyler Scott which jury‚Äôs not out on him yet but what if Waldron turns him into his Seattle version of Lockett? I‚Äôll wait. Every gm makes bad choices here and there (another ex: right off the bat in his intro press conference saying we will take the north and never give it back), no gms perfect. Fast forward to now and Poles has done a really good job with everything (ex: acquiring multiple starters, playmakers and hopefully this time assembling a well rounded, respected coaching staff), now he‚Äôs just gotta beef up that Oline since that‚Äôs his bread/butter and take some more edge rushers to find the right guy to pair opposite Sweat",mMSL0wYEoFY,UgybTPzXrGmhgKjVZa14AaABAg,False,

The team has made it so a 30td season from a rookie qb is quite actually plausible. Something that never would ever happen with Fields.  Any team loses their qb and they are fucked regardless of the hb. If Jacob‚Äôs gets get hurt, GB is beyond fucked. Henry is old, Cmac is a weapon not a guy who is going to rush for 1500yds a season.
